**Important notes:**

The engine is suitable for any kind of games, not only shooters, the fact that there are two 3d shooters that were made
with the engine, and a set of tutorials about 3d shooters just means that @mrDIMAS loves 3d shooters. There will be more
tutorials about games in different genre, but again - nothing stops you from making an RPG, RTS, rogue-like, etc.

## Features

- Exceptional safety, reliability, and speed.
- PC (Windows, Linux, macOS) and Web (WebAssembly) support - [Check online example](https://rg3d.rs/assets/webexample/index.html).
- Deferred shading.
	- Renderer based on OpenGL 3.3 Core (released in 2010) which means that your game will run on almost
	  any relatively modern GPU. 
	- Directional light.
	- Point light + shadows.
	- Spot light + shadows.
	- Bump mapping.
	- Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO).
	- Soft shadows.
	- Volumetric light (spot, point).
	- Instancing - render lots of objects without any overhead.
	- Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA)
	- Parallax mapping.
- Custom shaders and rendering techniques.
- Render in texture.
- Sky box.
- 2D support.
- Multi-camera rendering.
- Multiple scenes.
- Lightmap generator.
- Fully customizable vertex format.
- Level-of-detail (LOD) support.
- Scene graph with pivot, camera, mesh, light, particle system, sprite nodes.
- Built-in save/load - save/load the state of the engine in one call.
- [High quality binaural sound with HRTF support](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/tree/master/rg3d-sound).
- Skinning.
- Particle systems with soft particles.
- A* pathfinder.
- Navmesh.
- FBX Loader.
- Full TTF/OTF fonts support (thanks to [fontdue](https://github.com/mooman219/fontdue) and [ttf-parser](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/ttf-parser) crates).
- PNG, JPG, TGA, DDS, etc. textures (thanks to [image](https://github.com/image-rs/image) crate).
- Compressed textures support (DXT1, DXT3, DTX5)
- [Advanced node-based UI](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/tree/master/rg3d-ui) with lots of widgets.
- Animation blending state machine - similar to Mecanim in Unity Engine.
- Animation retargetting - allows you to remap animation from one model to another.
- Async asset management (textures, models, sound buffers).
- Advanced physics (thanks to the [rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) physics engine)
    - Rigid bodies.
    - Rich set of various colliders.
    - Joints.
    - Ray cast.
    - Many other useful features.
- [Core library](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rg3d/tree/master/rg3d-core).
- Fast iterative compilation 
	- Debug: ~3 seconds
	- Release: ~8 seconds
- Lots of examples.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q:** Does rg3d use ECS?

**A:** No. It uses generational pools (arenas) which are optimized for efficient
memory management to retain more static type safety.

**Q:** Examples running too slow on my PC, FPS is too low, help!

**A:** First, make sure you run examples on the discrete GPU, not on a built-in of your CPU. Built-in GPUs
are very slow and not suitable for rg3d. Second, make sure your discrete GPU is powerful enough to run 
modern games at a decent frame rate.
